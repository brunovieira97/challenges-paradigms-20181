# Fourth Challenge: Clojure
The context is Da Vinci's Code iconic scene with the Cryptex. 

We must write a Clojure program that receives a word and delivers anagrams for it. This program must also work like the Cryptex: secondarily, it will receive the password one character at a time, recursively validating the entered string, and then verifying if it matches the pre-defined password.
